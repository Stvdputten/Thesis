In this chapter, related work will be described. In section \ref{theory:relatedwork}, research conducted on twitter tweets and cyber security are reviewed. In section \ref{theory:featureextraction}, research that has been conducted on extracting and transforming logs to feature. Section \ref{theory:machinelearning} introduces the previous applications of topic modelling on system logs.
The last section \ref{theory:buildingblocks} introduces the tools and frameworks applied for this study.

??Latent Dirichlet Allocation is used for topic modelling on a corpera of documents. A lot of research has been performed in this area for different applications. The application of LDA ranges from image recognition to simple document topic discovery. 
In the following sections we will look at different applications, similar works and also explain the building blocks of this research.

\section{Related work} \label{theory:relatedwork}
An interesting adaptation of topic modelling can be found in twitter and cyber security. Twitter is a interesting field of research with real time tweets and a huge community. Due to the nature of twitter, analysing the huge stream of tweets can be a challenging and exhaustive task. A model with LDA has been introduced to analyse and detect topics. This model is an interesting way to provide news feeds even quicker then traditional news sites \cite{Zhao2011ComparingModels}. Cyber security has also been an area which LDA seems applicable to. Through the usage of Big data and combination of LDA, users could be identified through system and network logs. Using the event logs to identify topics, new events of users could be identified as malicious or normal \cite{Jingwei2014KnowledgeLDA}.

\section{Machine learning} \label{theory:machinelearning}
In the field of computer science, machine learning is used to learn computers to classify or predict without explicitly being programmed to do so. Generally machine learning can be divided in supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. The dataset that has been acquired 
The main goal of this paper a form of unsupervised machine learning.
 Learning can be done supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised. Supervised learning makes use of labeled data, which makes it easy to train and evaluate the model. Unsupervised learning makes use of unlabeled data by recognizing patterns in the data. Semi-supervised learns using both unlabelled and labelled data.

\subsection{Hard and Soft clustering}
While hard and soft clustering are both a form of clustering, this researches contains both forms. The results discussed in chapter \ref{ch:result} contains results based both upon hard and soft clustering. Clustering data can be achieved by giving every element of the data at most 1 label, this is called hard clustering. Soft clustering allows data to be part of multiple clusters or contain multiple labels. Especially when talking about topic modelling, every document is a mixture of multiple topics this by itself is already a form of soft clustering. To avoid confusion what this research means with clustering, this section was added.

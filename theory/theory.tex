In this chapter, related work will be described. In section \ref{theory:relatedwork}, research conducted on twitter tweets and cyber security are reviewed. In section \ref{theory:featureextraction}, research that has been conducted on extracting and transforming logs to features are described. Section \ref{theory:machinelearning} introduces the previous applications of topic modelling on system logs. The last section \ref{theory:buildingblocks} introduces the tools and frameworks applied during this research.

\section{Topic modelling in general} \label{theory:relatedwork}
In this section, we briefly describe and show two researches that applied topic modelling for different use cases. The descriptions will end with an overview explaining which parts are relevant to our current research. \par

\setlength{\parindent}{3ex} A research conducted in 2011 makes use of the numerous amounts of tweets on Twitter. Twitter is an online platform used to message about social media and news. Users make posts called tweets that are restricted to 140 characters. The authors are interested in finding news topics from twitter feeds and comparing the topics with traditional news feeds using LDA.

The authors start with preparing 3 months worth of tweets of users and news feed data from New York Times. The tweets are filtered on stop words and tweets appearing more than 70\% of the time and less than 10 times are removed. The authors recognise that LDA does not perform very well on small tweets. To better fit the data to LDA, the authors aggregate the tweets of each user to a single document. The data is represented in a Bag of Words matrix and fitted to their custom Twitter-LDA model. The authors continue comparing the traditional LDA model and their own model using two human judges. The judges compare the generated topics, which are 10 words long and a mixture of words, using a scoring mechanism. The scored is based on each topics distinction and cohesion of words. The final results show that their Twitter-LDA model is better compared to the traditional LDA model. The results of their model showed more informative topics, which could  not be extracted from the traditional news source \cite{Zhao2011ComparingModels}. 

The second research is published in 2014 with the intention of exploring a Big data use case. The National Center of Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) generates around 4.5 GB of data each day. The data are collected from security monitoring and system logs. The authors study a new approach of LDA on logs files for intrusion detection. The authors propose that LDA can be used to detect patterns in log events. The model is trained to recognise normal activities and abnormal behaviour patterns, described in the probability distribution of the topics over a data set. The model is also capable of detecting the semantics of the log events, which provide a higher level description of the intention of an user \cite{Jingwei2014KnowledgeLDA}. 

In our research we will apply ideas mentioned in both researches. Our dataset extracted is similarly structured to tweets, which are short and domain specific. The domain specific nature of our research is also explored in the second research paper. The second research propose an approach for using log files to detect intrusion, which is similar to our problem of detecting errors. The evaluation in both researches is based on human judgements and semantic pattern recognition, which both depend on the distinct nature of the topics. In other words, if the topics in the model can detected pattern it will have distinct topics.

\section{Feature extraction from Logs}\label{theory:featureextraction}
!!!!
Numerous log files are outputted by different servers, e.g. web server logs, system logs, etc. A log includes data that can be numerical or non-numerical data, depending on the format and source of the log. The content of each log can be used for feature extraction. Using text mining to extract the textual content from each log is suffice to be able to use the logs for our research.

By comparing a traditional news source with
Topic modelling is a very popular and high researched field. While topic modelling  
An interesting adaptation of topic modelling can be found in twitter and cyber security. Twitter is a interesting field of research with real time tweets and a huge community. Due to the nature of twitter, analysing the huge stream of tweets can be a challenging and exhaustive task. A model with LDA has been introduced to analyse and detect topics. This model is an interesting way to provide news feeds even quicker then traditional news sites . Cyber security has also been an area which LDA seems applicable to. Through the usage of Big data and combination of LDA, users could be identified through system and network logs. Using the event logs to identify topics, new events of users could be identified as malicious or normal 


Logs are created in different kind of types, e.g. server logs, event logs and a lot more. The servers logs in the data set are streamed using Apache NiFi. Logs can be numerical data, but also contain non-numerical data. The messages confined in logs are textual and as such can be analysed through Natural Language Processing.
The data that logs can include can be numerical data and non-numerical data



\section{Machine learning} \label{theory:machinelearning}
In the field of computer science, machine learning is used to learn computers to classify or predict without explicitly being programmed to do so. Generally machine learning can be divided in supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning. The dataset that has been acquired 
The main goal of this paper a form of unsupervised machine learning.
Learning can be done supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised. Supervised learning makes use of labeled data, which makes it easy to train and evaluate the model. Unsupervised learning makes use of unlabeled data by recognizing patterns in the data. Semi-supervised learns using both unlabelled and labelled data.

\subsection{Hard and Soft clustering}
Machine learning divides cluster into two types, hard and soft. Hard and soft clustering are both a form of clustering, this researches contains both forms. The results discussed in chapter \ref{ch:result} contains results based both upon hard and soft clustering. Clustering data can be achieved by giving every element of the data at most 1 label, this is called hard clustering. Soft clustering allows data to be part of multiple clusters or contain multiple labels. Especially when talking about topic modelling, every document is a mixture of multiple topics this by itself is already a form of soft clustering. To avoid confusion what this research means with clustering, this section was added.
